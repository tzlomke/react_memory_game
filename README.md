# React Memory Game
The React Memory Game is a front-end application bootstrapped with Create React App.
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The user's goal is to click each of 12 game cards without clicking any of them twice. Upon clicking a card, the deck is shuffled. Users are notified upon victory or failure. The game is themed upon the SyFy/Amazon series _the Expanse_. You should watch it. Before playing. A win or a loss will reveal minor *spoilers*.

The React Memory Game relies on a handful of stateless React components nested within a larger stateful React component.

## Motivation for Development
The React Memory Game represents my first application using the React Library. Development was motivated by a desire to further understand a powerful front-end JavaScript library.
